# Age_Guesser
## Abstract:
In recent years, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is popular and widely used in computer vision tasks, and many related applications and datasets are proposed. In the final project, I aimed to propose an application that predicts human ages, which is interesting and useful in the real world. I used 3 human face datasets to train the convolutional neural network models that predicted human ages based on the face images. In addition, I improved the model architecture and evaluated accuracies between different datasets and model architectures. Lastly, I used the OpenCV package to implement the real-time age-guesser application.
## Age Guesser Application
I used the OpenCV package to build the real-time age guesser application. Firstly, I used the VideoCapture in OpenCV to capture frames from the webcam in real-time. Secondly, I used the face detection model provided by OpenCV to get the bounding boxes of faces. Note that the detection model can detect multiple faces in a single frame, thus, I may get multiple bounding boxes. Then, I cropped the face images in bounding boxes from the frame and resized the face images to the input size of our age guesser model. Lastly, I used the model to predict the ages of face images and showed the predicted ages on the screen.
* 1. Predicting face accurately
In most of the test cases, the model could predict human ages accurately.

* 2. Predicting multiple facesâ€™ ages in a frame
Our application can detect multiple faces in a frame and predict ages of faces.

## Methods:
A. Datasets
* 1.The OUI-Audience Face Image Project
Consists of 26580 photos.
the images were labeled in groups by the age ranges: 0-2, 4-6, 8-13, 15-20, 25-32, 38-43, 48-53, 60+
* 2.UTKFace
Consists of 20k+ face images in the wild, which are labelled by age, gender, and ethnicity.
* 3.Facial Age
10k+ images which were labelled by age.
B. Data Preprocessing
1. Label ages in group
Since the OUI-Adience Face Image Project labeled ages in groups, we labeled the ages in group in others datasets for the consistency.
2. Balances the datasets by the age labels
Regulate the distribution ratio of each label by sampling the fixed number of images in each class.
* C. Model Architectures
